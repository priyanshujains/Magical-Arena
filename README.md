# Magical Arena

## Overview
The Magical Arena is a simple Java program simulating a battle between two players. Each player has attributes for health, strength, and attack. Players take turns attacking and defending based on dice rolls until the health of one player reaches 0.

The game picks the player with lesser health to start with. Damage from an attacking die-throw is combined with the damage from a defending die-roll and subtracted from his health. Finally, when the battle ends, the program declares a winner.
